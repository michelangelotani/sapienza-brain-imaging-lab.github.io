# BIL public site
Public BIL site based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) template

To contribute to the BIL site, first install Docker Desktop and Visual Studio Code on your computer. Then clone this repository and open your working copy using Visual Studio Code. When opening it for the first time, VS Code will ask you to install some recommended extensions and to auto-execute some tasks at startup: please allow both requests.

You can then start adding contents to the site, or modifying the existing contents. Point your browser to http://localhost:4000 to see the modified version of the site, auto-updated every time you save.

Push your working copy to automatically publish the new version of the site.
