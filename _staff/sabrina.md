My research activity covers topics in the field of Psychophysiology and Cognitive Neuroscience. I am interested in the interaction of vision with action, and I use neuroimaging methods (MRI and fMRI) to study brain activity related to perceptual, cognitive and sensorimotor functions in healthy individuals and in patients with neurological disorders. Part of my research is dedicated to the identification of homologies between human and macaque brain. Often, the studies combine neuroimaging with psychophysical and electrophysiological (ERP) methods.
