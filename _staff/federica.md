description: I am a 2nd year PhD student in Behavioral Neuroscience. The subjective experience of how we perceive and interact with the environment is my general field of interest. I worked with TMS and EEG, but now I am totally an "fMRI girl" who aims to investigate visual and visuomotor intra- and inter-hemispheric dynamics. When I am not playing with brains, I eat (a lot), I cook (decently), and I play tennis (badly). But I mostly love Scuderia Ferrari, Magritte, Irène Némirovsky and my squirrel.
