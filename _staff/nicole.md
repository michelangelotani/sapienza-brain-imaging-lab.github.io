I'm a 2nd year student in the Cognitive Neuroscience master's program. In the mornings, as a thesis student I investigate the relationship between visuo-spatial attention and semantic memory. In the afternoons, as an intern, I (try and fail) to design experiments with eye trackers to improve the rehabilitation process for a patient. After 9PM, you will find me catching Z's, with a spritz never too far away.
