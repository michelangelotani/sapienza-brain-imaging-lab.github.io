I am currently investigating target updating during reach-to-grasp actions in an innovative fMRI setup that include a cutting-edge motion tracking system, which streams kinematics in real-time to virtual reality. My research interests involve sensorimotor integration, predictive coding and how sensorimotor circuitry is recycled in embodied cognition. I am a curious guy by nature, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
