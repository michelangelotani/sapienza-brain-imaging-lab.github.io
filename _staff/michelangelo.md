I am student in Cognitive Neuroscience MsC. I am carrying out my thesis research on prediction error in monitoring goal-relevant visual cues during hand movements. This exciting project is conducted in an innovative fMRI setting which includes MRI-compatible virtual reality, cameras motion capture system and optic fiber glove. I am a curious guy by nature, I listen to hardcore punk and I love adventure travel.
