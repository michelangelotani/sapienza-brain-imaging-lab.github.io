I am a MSc student in Cognitive Neuroscience and intern in Brain Imaging Lab. Currently, I am taking a role in behavioral part of the Social Grasping experiment. As a 2nd year master student, I am really interested in the tools and programmes which I am using right now, so I believe that I will find a perfect project to be a part of also for my thesis . Besides of these, I am a real movie lover. I believe that everyone can get huge amount of knowdlege and details about the cultures with watching their movies, all you need is to choose the right directors.
